# Web Application Django
Here are the requirent for this project:
Step 1:
Pizzeria: Start a new project called pizzeria with an app called pizzas. Define a model Pizza with a field called name, which will hold name values such as Hawaiian and Meat Lovers. Define a model called Topping with fields called pizzaand name. The pizza field should be a foreign key to Pizza, and name should be able to hold values such as pineapple, Canadian bacon, and sausage.

Register both models with the admin site, and use the site to enter some pizza names and toppings. Use the shell to explore the data you entered.

Step 2:
Pizzeria Home Page: Add a home page to the Pizzeria project you started in Exercise 18-4 (page 412).

Step 3:
Pizzeria Pages: Add a page to the Pizzeria project from Exercise 18-6 (page 416) that shows the names of available pizzas. Then link each pizza name to a page displaying the pizzaâ€™s toppings. Make sure you use template inheritance to build your pages efficiently.
